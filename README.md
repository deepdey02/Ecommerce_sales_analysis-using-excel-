Interactive dashboard creation using excel
 Excited to share my first Excel project! 

I worked on E-commerce Sales Data (2011–2014) and built an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze business performance.

Key highlights of my analysis:

Cleaned and structured raw sales data for accuracy
Used Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers for interactive insights
Incorporated clustered column charts, bar charts, control combo box & data analysis add-in
Analyzed year-over-year growth in Sales, Profit, Orders, and Quantity
Identified Top 5 Sub-categories and Category-wise performance
Visualized regional sales distribution across states

 The dashboard provides a clear view of sales trends, profit margins, and product growth—helping make data-driven decisions.
This project not only strengthened my Excel skills but also gave me hands-on experience in turning raw data into actionable insights.
